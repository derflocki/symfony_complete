INTRODUCTION

It is possible to have this script in your own account by copying symfony_complete to a place in your account (say ~/symfony_complete) and add the following line to your .bash_profile (typically at ~/.bash_profile, you can create it if it does not exist):

if [ -e ~/symfony_complete ]; then
	. ~/symfony_complete
fi
